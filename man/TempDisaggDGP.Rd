\description{
This function generates the high-frequency \eqn{mn_l \times 1} response vector \eqn{y}, according to \eqn{y=X\beta+\epsilon}, where \eqn{X} is an \eqn{mn_l\times p} matrix of indicator
series, and the \eqn{mn_l\times 1} coefficient vector may be sparse. The low-frequency \eqn{n_l\times 1} vector \eqn{Y}
can be generated by pre-multiplying a disaggregation matrix \eqn{n_l\times mn_l} matrix, such that the sum, the average, the last or the first value of \eqn{y} equates the
corresponding \eqn{Y} observation. For a comprehensive review, see \insertCite{dagum2006benchmarking;textual}{TSdisaggregation}.
